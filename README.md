# Hello, World! :earth_americas:

###### _Ugh, I'm not good at introductions, but here goes my best attempt:_ :flushed:

I'm **jabonchan**. I like coding <sup><sub>well, yeah, why else would I be doing this?</sub></sup>. I don't really have any studies related to programming;
I've learned pretty much everything through my own research, so don't expect high-quality stuff here :man_shrugging:.

As you may have already noticed, my native language isn't English. My native language is Spanish, and, as with everything programming-related I know, I
learned English on my own, so I may or may not make mistakes when using it.

In case you're wondering <sup><sub>you're probably not</sup></sub>, I started researching/learning all this stuff when I was 9 <sup><sub>Not gonna say a lot here,
but I have already surpassed a decade since I started :partying_face:</sub></sup>. So, I guess that despite not having a lot of _"high-quality code practices"_, I
do feel I have somewhat decent programming skills. I can achieve what I want, so, uh, that's great <sup><sub>I guess</sub></sup>.

### So, what do you know?

That's a great question! Well, a bit of some things, the basics _â€”in SOME cases more in-depth knowledgeâ€”_ of things like...

- **AI** :robot:
  - The overall idea behind what it is and how it works.
  - Basic and common neural network models.
  - Concepts behind machine learning. Evolutionary algorithms for the win! <sup><sub>Don't blame me, it's easier imo</sub></sup>.
  - Coded my own implementation once, ended up trashing it later though <sup><sub>Totally not because it sucked :sweat_smile:</sub></sup>.
 
- **Hardware and Low-Level stuff** :desktop_computer:
  - If you mention a piece of hardware, I <sup><sub>probably</sub></sup> know what it does <sup><sub>I always forget what the acronyms stand for though :roll_eyes:</sub></sup>.
  - MMU, I/O, architecture, and that kind of stuff.
 
- **Graphics** :paintbrush:
  - Do I know a shader language? Well, not really.
  - I used the Wii U's GX2 API once <sup><sub>Totally not copy-pasted code</sub></sup>.
  - I do know different shader types exist! But that's it.
  - Extremely unoptimized ray tracing. Yay!
    
- **Physics** :ringed_planet:
  - When I say the basics, I REALLY mean the basics.
  - Some stuff like EM waves, frequency, blah blah.
  - The aether doesn't exist <sup><sub>Sorry Minecraft mods</sub></sup>.

- **Exploits** :scissors:
  - So, I am totally NOT capable of developing my own exploit.
  - I can understand when you explain it though <sup><sub>I think, take it with a grain of salt, **wiiubrew.org** is my teacher</sub></sup>.
  - So there's overflows, ROP, XSS, and probably more stuff that I don't know.
 
- **Programming** :pencil2:
  - I feel confident coding in JavaScript and TypeScript.
  - Deno ðŸ¦• and Node.js :green_square: <sup><sub>Haven't used it in a while though</sub></sup>. <!-- Why is there no dinosaur emoji in markdown...? -->
  - The basics-not-so-basics of C++. My hardest project was coding a Wii U homebrew app <sup><sub>Whether it was a success or not is a different story</sub></sup>.
  - The basics of the <sup><sub>awful</sub></sup> Windows API.

### You seem to have tons of free time, do you have a life?

Haha, no. As any good programmer, I don't sleep, eat, or behave like a normal human being <sup><sub>The latter is not because of being a programmer though</sub></sup>.
I don't have a job <sup><sub>Never had one, not sure if I should cry or laugh :upside_down_face:</sub></sup>.

### Anyways, what do you like doing?

Thanks! You probably didn't ask, but here goes my explanation of my hobbies, like I did back in elementary school <sup><sub>That is, introducing myself in
an extremely awkward way</sub></sup>. I draw sometimes, sing all day <sup><sub>That's very unfortunate for my neighbors</sub></sup>, play video games _â€”Mario
and Kirby :pink_heart: are the best. Oh, also the green Mario is coolâ€”_, play instruments, and, did I already mention I like programming?

### Why do you mention all this stuff? This is GitHub, not Club Penguin.

idk, why did you read it all?
