# Hello, World! 🌍

###### _Ugh, I'm not good at introductions, but here it goes my best attempt;_ 😳

I'm **jabonchan**. I like coding <sup><sub>well, yeah, why else would I be doing this?</sub></sup>. I don't really have any studies related to programming, I've learned pretty much everything through my own research, so don't expect high-quality stuff here ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

And, as you may have already noticed, my native language isn't English. My native language is Spanish, and, as same with everything programming-related I know, I learned English on my own, so I may or may not make mistakes when using it.

And in case you're wondering <sup><sub>you're probably not</sup></sub>, I started researching/learning all this stuff since I was 9 <sup><sub>Not gonna say a lot here, but I have already surpassed 1 decade since I started 🥳</sup></sub>, so I guess that, despite not having a lot of _"high-quality code practices"_, I do feel I have somewhat decent skills in programming, I can achieve what I want so, uh, that's great <sup><sub>I guess</sup></sub>

### So, what do you know?

That's a great question! Well, a bit of some things, the basics _—in SOME cases more in-deep knowledge—_ of things like...

- **AI** 🤖
  - The overall idea behing what it is, how it works.
  - Basic and common neural-network models.
  - Concepts behind machine learning. Evolutive algorithm for the win! <sup><sub>Don't blame me, it's easier imo</sup></sub>
  - Coded my own implementation once, ended up trashing it later tho <sup><sub>Totally not because it sucked 😅</sup></sub>
 
- **Hardware and Low-Level stuff** 💻
  - If you mention a piece of hardware, I <sup><sub>probably</sup></sub> know what it does <sup><sub>I always forget what the acronymoms stand for tho ¬_¬</sup></sub>
  - MMU, I/O, architecture, and that kind of stuff.
 
- **Graphics** 🎨
  - Do I know a shader language? Well, not really.
  - I used the Wii U's GX2 API once <sup><sub>Totally not copy-pasted code</sup></sub>
  - I do know different shaders type exist! But that's it.
  - Extremely unoptimized ray-raytracing. Yey!
    
- **Physics** 🪐
  - When I say the basics, I REALLY mean the basics.
  - Some stuff like EM waves, frequency, blah blah.
  - The aether doesn't exists <sup><sub>Sorry minecraft mods</sup></sub>

- **Exploits** ✂️
  - So I am totally NOT capable of developing my own exploit.
  - I can understand when you explain it tho <sup><sub>I think, take it with a grain of salt, **wiiubrew.org** is my teacher</sup></sub>
  - So there's overflows, ROP, XSS, and probably more stuff that I don't know.
 
- **Programming** 🖋️
  - I feel confident coding in JavaScript and TypeScript.
  - Deno 🦕 and Node.js 🟩 <sup><sub>Haven't used it in a while tho</sup></sub>
  - The basics-not-so-basics of C++. My biggest project was coding a Wii U homebrew app <sup><sub>Whenever it was a success or not is a different story</sup></sub>
  - The basics of the <sup><sub>awful</sup></sub> Windows API.
